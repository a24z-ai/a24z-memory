# Repository-Specific Storage Test Coverage

## ‚úÖ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Modified `getRepositoryDataDir` Function

- **Location**: `src/core-mcp/store/notesStore.ts`
- **Change**: Added support for `A24Z_USE_REPO_STORAGE` environment variable
- **Behavior**:
  - When `A24Z_USE_REPO_STORAGE=true` is set, tests use repository-specific `.a24z` directories
  - When not set, tests use the shared test directory for isolation
  - Production always uses repository-specific storage

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage

#### Repository Isolation Tests (`tests/core-mcp/store/repositoryIsolation.test.ts`)

‚úÖ **All 10 tests passing**

**Coverage includes:**

- Separate `.a24z` directories for each repository
- No cross-contamination between repositories
- Subdirectory storage in repository root
- Parent note retrieval from subdirectories
- Cross-repository query prevention
- Tag isolation between repositories
- MCP tool isolation
- Nested repository handling
- Orphan directory handling
- Concurrent saves to multiple repositories

#### Repository Storage Tests (`tests/core-mcp/store/repositoryStorage.test.ts`)

‚úÖ **All 11 tests passing**

**Coverage includes:**

- Path normalization to repository root
- Project root detection from package.json
- Repository name extraction
- File storage in `.a24z` directory
- Note retrieval from repository storage
- Nested path retrieval
- Multiple notes in same repository
- Tag retrieval from repository
- Repository isolation
- MCP tool integration

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/repositorySpecificRetrieval.test.ts`)

‚úÖ **All 3 tests passing**

**Coverage includes:**

- End-to-end storage and retrieval flow
- Nested path retrieval with parent notes
- Cross-repository isolation verification

## üìä Test Results Summary

```
Repository-Specific Storage Tests: ‚úÖ 24/24 tests passing
- Repository Isolation: 10/10 ‚úÖ
- Repository Storage: 11/11 ‚úÖ
- Integration Tests: 3/3 ‚úÖ
```

## üîç Key Verification Points

### 1. Storage Location

- ‚úÖ Notes are stored in `<repository-root>/.a24z/repository-notes.json`
- ‚úÖ Subdirectory notes are stored in repository root, not subdirectories
- ‚úÖ Each repository has its own isolated storage

### 2. Retrieval Behavior

- ‚úÖ Notes can be retrieved from exact paths
- ‚úÖ Parent notes are found when querying from subdirectories
- ‚úÖ Notes from other repositories are never returned
- ‚úÖ Path distance calculation works correctly

### 3. Cross-Repository Isolation

- ‚úÖ Notes saved in repo1 are never visible in repo2
- ‚úÖ Tag lists are repository-specific
- ‚úÖ Concurrent operations don't cause cross-contamination
- ‚úÖ Nested repositories maintain their own storage

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage in Tests

To enable repository-specific storage in tests:

```javascript
beforeAll(() => {
  // Enable repository-specific storage
  process.env.A24Z_USE_REPO_STORAGE = 'true';
});

afterAll(() => {
  // Clean up
  delete process.env.A24Z_USE_REPO_STORAGE;
});
```

## üéØ Retrieval Issue Resolution

The retrieval issues were caused by:

1. **Test environment override**: `A24Z_TEST_DATA_DIR` was forcing all notes into a single directory
2. **No repository isolation**: Notes from different repositories were mixing

**Solution implemented**:

- Modified `getRepositoryDataDir` to respect `A24Z_USE_REPO_STORAGE` flag
- Tests can now verify true repository-specific storage
- Production behavior remains unchanged (always uses repository-specific storage)

## ‚úÖ Verification Complete

All repository-specific storage functionality is now:

1. **Properly implemented** in the codebase
2. **Thoroughly tested** with comprehensive test coverage
3. **Verified working** for storage, retrieval, and isolation

The MCP server correctly:

- Stores notes in repository-specific `.a24z` directories
- Retrieves notes only from the queried repository
- Maintains complete isolation between different repositories
- Handles nested paths and parent note retrieval correctly
