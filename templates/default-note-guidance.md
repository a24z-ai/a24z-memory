### ‚ö° Performance Insights

- Document performance optimizations and bottlenecks discovered
- Include metrics before/after where applicable
- Example: "Lazy loading components reduced initial bundle size by 40%"
- **Tags**: `performance`, `optimization`

## Preferred Tags

### Technical Areas

- `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `api`
- `authentication`, `security`, `performance`
- `testing`, `deployment`, `configuration`

### Common Frameworks & Tools

- Add project-specific technologies here

## Note Quality Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Include code examples and file paths
- **Be actionable**: Focus on what future developers should know
- **Be concise**: Aim for 1-3 paragraphs per note
- **Include context**: Explain why, not just what
- **Link to related code**: Use `[filename.ts](path/to/file.ts)` format

## Example Note Structure

```markdown
## Component State Management Pattern

When creating new React components that need shared state, use the custom `useSharedState` hook located in `src/hooks/useSharedState.ts` instead of prop drilling.

**Why**: Reduces component coupling and makes state updates more predictable.

**Example**: See `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` for proper implementation.

**Tags**: react, pattern, state-management
