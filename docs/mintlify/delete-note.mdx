# delete_note

Delete a specific repository note from the knowledge base. Use with caution as deleted notes cannot be recovered.

## Overview

The `delete_note` tool allows you to remove notes that are outdated, incorrect, or no longer relevant. This helps maintain the quality and accuracy of the repository's knowledge base.

<RequestExample>
```json
{
  "noteId": "note-1734567890123-abc123def",
  "directoryPath": "/Users/project/my-app"
}
```
</RequestExample>

## Parameters

| Parameter       | Type   | Required | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `noteId`        | string | Yes      | Unique ID of the note to delete (format: note-timestamp-hash) |
| `directoryPath` | string | Yes      | Repository root path to identify the correct repository       |

## Response Format

### Successful Deletion

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Note deleted successfully",
  "noteId": "note-1734567890123-abc123def"
}
```

### Note Not Found

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Note not found",
  "noteId": "note-1734567890123-abc123def",
  "suggestion": "Verify the note ID is correct and the note exists"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Remove Outdated Information

```json
{
  "noteId": "note-1734567890123-abc123def",
  "directoryPath": "/Users/project/my-app"
}
```

**Use Case**: A note about a deprecated library or outdated practice that should be removed.

### Example 2: Clean Up After Refactoring

```json
{
  "noteId": "note-1734567890123-xyz789ghi",
  "directoryPath": "/Users/project/my-app"
}
```

**Use Case**: Remove notes about code patterns that have been refactored or replaced.

## Best Practices

### When to Delete Notes

1. **Outdated Information**: Remove notes about deprecated technologies or practices
2. **Incorrect Information**: Delete notes that contain factual errors
3. **Redundant Information**: Remove duplicate notes (consider merging instead)
4. **Irrelevant Information**: Delete notes no longer relevant to the project

### When NOT to Delete Notes

1. **Historical Context**: Keep notes about architectural decisions even if changed
2. **Learning Opportunities**: Preserve notes about mistakes and their solutions
3. **Migration Guides**: Keep notes about how systems were changed
4. **Team Knowledge**: Maintain notes about team processes and conventions

## Error Handling

### Repository Not Found

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Repository not found at the specified path",
  "suggestion": "Ensure the directoryPath points to a valid repository root"
}
```

### Permission Denied

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Permission denied deleting note",
  "suggestion": "Check file permissions for the repository directory"
}
```

### Invalid Note ID

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid note ID format",
  "noteId": "invalid-id",
  "suggestion": "Note IDs should have format: note-timestamp-hash"
}
```

## Safety Considerations

### Confirmation Recommended

Always confirm with the user before deleting notes, especially:

- High-confidence notes (may contain important institutional knowledge)
- Notes with many tags or anchors (widely referenced)
- Decision-type notes (document architectural choices)

### Backup Strategy

Consider backing up important notes before deletion by:

1. Exporting note content to documentation
2. Creating a summary note referencing the deletion
3. Moving critical information to permanent documentation

## Integration with AI Agents

AI agents should:

1. **Confirm deletions** with users for important notes
2. **Check note usage** before deletion (search for references)
3. **Document deletions** in a changelog or audit trail
4. **Suggest alternatives** like updating rather than deleting
