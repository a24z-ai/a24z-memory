# Best Practices

This guide covers proven strategies for maximizing the value of A24z Memory in your development workflow. Learn how to create a culture of knowledge sharing and maintain high-quality documentation.

## Knowledge Management Strategy

### Start Small, Grow Organically

**Begin with high-impact areas**:

- Document architectural decisions that affect the entire team
- Capture solutions to frequently encountered problems
- Record complex business logic that isn't obvious from code alone

**Avoid documentation overload**:

- Focus on "why" and "when" rather than obvious "how"
- Don't document simple utility functions or obvious patterns
- Let the knowledge base evolve naturally with project needs

### Establish Team Conventions

**Create consistent tagging standards**:

```json
// Good: Specific and actionable tags
["authentication", "jwt", "error-handling", "security"]

// Avoid: Generic or unclear tags
["code", "stuff", "important"]
```

**Define note types clearly**:

- **Decision**: Use for architectural choices with rationale
- **Pattern**: Use for reusable implementation approaches
- **Gotcha**: Use for common pitfalls and their solutions
- **Explanation**: Use for complex concepts that need clarification

### Regular Knowledge Base Maintenance

**Schedule periodic reviews**:

- Monthly review of outdated information
- Quarterly cleanup of unused or irrelevant notes
- Annual reorganization of knowledge structure

**Encourage team participation**:

- Rotate knowledge base maintenance responsibilities
- Recognize team members who contribute valuable insights
- Make documentation part of the development process

## Effective Note Creation

### Write Actionable Notes

**Include concrete examples**:

```
❌ Bad: "Use proper error handling"
✅ Good: "Wrap API calls in try-catch blocks and use the ErrorHandler utility from /src/utils/errorHandler.ts"
```

**Provide context and reasoning**:

```
❌ Bad: "Chose React Query"
✅ Good: "Chose React Query over Redux for server state because it provides automatic caching, background refetching, and better developer experience for API interactions"
```

### Use Proper Anchoring

**Attach notes to relevant locations**:

```json
{
  "note": "Custom hook for API authentication",
  "directoryPath": "/src/hooks",
  "anchors": ["/src/hooks/useAuth.ts", "/src/hooks/useApi.ts", "/src/components/LoginForm.tsx"]
}
```

**Use directory-level anchoring for broad topics**:

```json
{
  "note": "Project-wide TypeScript configuration standards",
  "directoryPath": "/src",
  "anchors": ["/tsconfig.json", "/src/types"]
}
```

### Leverage Tags Effectively

**Use technology tags**:

- `react`, `typescript`, `nodejs` - Core technologies
- `testing`, `security`, `performance` - Cross-cutting concerns

**Combine with purpose tags**:

- `authentication` + `api` + `security` - Specific feature area
- `error-handling` + `user-experience` - Implementation approach

**Create custom tags for domain-specific concepts**:

- `micro-frontend`, `shared-library` - Architecture patterns
- `customer-portal`, `admin-dashboard` - Business domains

## AI Agent Integration Patterns

### Proactive Knowledge Queries

**Configure AI agents to query before decisions**:

```typescript
// AI Agent workflow
const existingPatterns = await askA24zMemory({
  filePath: currentFile,
  query: 'What patterns exist for [specific task]?',
});

if (existingPatterns.results.length > 0) {
  // Apply existing patterns
} else {
  // Create new pattern and document it
}
```

**Use contextual queries**:

- "How does this project handle [specific pattern]?"
- "What were the architectural decisions for [component/feature]?"
- "What are common gotchas in [technology/area]?"

### Intelligent Note Creation

**Create notes at appropriate times**:

- After solving complex problems that might recur
- When making decisions that affect other team members
- When discovering non-obvious solutions
- When establishing new patterns or conventions

**Include AI agent context**:

```json
{
  "note": "Discovered that API calls to /user/profile fail silently during network timeouts. Added exponential backoff retry logic.",
  "directoryPath": "/src/api",
  "tags": ["api", "error-handling", "network", "resilience"],
  "type": "gotcha",
  "metadata": {
    "discovered_by": "ai_agent_assisted_debugging",
    "affected_endpoints": ["/user/profile", "/user/settings"]
  }
}
```

### Continuous Learning Loop

**Learn from successful interactions**:

- Track which notes are most valuable to the team
- Identify patterns in successful queries
- Refine system prompts based on effectiveness

**Improve query quality**:

- Start with specific, contextual queries
- Use follow-up questions to gather more details
- Learn from the types of information that are most helpful

## Team Collaboration

### Knowledge Sharing Culture

**Make documentation part of development**:

- Include note creation in pull request templates
- Review notes as part of code review process
- Encourage pair programming with knowledge capture

**Create team rituals**:

- Weekly "knowledge sharing" sessions
- Monthly "lessons learned" documentation
- Quarterly knowledge base cleanup sprints

### Cross-Team Knowledge Sharing

**Share relevant patterns across projects**:

- Document reusable utilities and patterns
- Create organization-wide knowledge repositories
- Establish communities of practice around technologies

**Learn from other teams**:

- Subscribe to updates from related projects
- Participate in cross-team knowledge sharing sessions
- Create shared repositories for common patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Note Quality Standards

**Ensure accuracy and relevance**:

- Review notes for technical accuracy
- Update notes when code changes
- Mark outdated information clearly
- Remove truly obsolete content

**Maintain consistency**:

- Use consistent terminology across notes
- Follow established formatting conventions
- Apply tags consistently
- Keep file paths current

### Knowledge Base Health

**Monitor usage patterns**:

- Track which notes are accessed most frequently
- Identify gaps in documentation
- Find areas where more guidance is needed
- Remove notes that are never accessed

**Regular audits**:

- Check for broken file references
- Validate code examples still work
- Ensure tags are still relevant
- Confirm architectural decisions are current

## Advanced Patterns

### Repository-Specific Guidance

**Create custom configuration**:

```json
// .a24z-memory.json
{
  "noteGuidance": {
    "creationGuidelines": "Include performance implications for all database operations",
    "requiredFields": ["note", "directoryPath", "tags", "performance_impact"],
    "contentStandards": "All database operations must include query complexity analysis"
  },
  "tagRestrictions": {
    "requiredTags": ["performance"],
    "allowedTags": ["database", "query-optimization", "indexing", "caching"]
  }
}
```

**Use custom templates**:

```json
{
  "templates": {
    "databaseOperation": "# Database Operation\n\n**Query**: [SQL/Description]\n\n**Performance Impact**: [Analysis]\n\n**Optimization**: [Strategy]\n\n**Monitoring**: [Metrics]"
  }
}
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

**CI/CD Integration**:

- Validate knowledge base health in CI
- Check for broken references
- Ensure new code follows documented patterns
- Generate documentation from code when possible

**IDE Integration**:

- Show relevant notes when opening files
- Provide quick actions for creating notes
- Display context-aware suggestions
- Integrate with code completion

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Adoption

**If team members aren't using A24z Memory**:

- Provide training and examples
- Show concrete value through use cases
- Make it easy to get started
- Celebrate successful usage

**If AI agents aren't querying effectively**:

- Review and improve system prompt
- Provide better examples and context
- Train on successful interaction patterns
- Adjust similarity thresholds

### Knowledge Quality Issues

**If notes are low quality**:

- Provide clear guidelines and templates
- Review notes as part of code review
- Offer training on effective documentation
- Lead by example with high-quality notes

**If information becomes outdated**:

- Establish review processes
- Use version tags for time-sensitive information
- Mark deprecated content clearly
- Encourage regular updates
