# askA24zMemory

The primary tool for querying the A24z Memory knowledge base. This tool retrieves relevant notes and synthesizes answers based on contextual information about your codebase.

## Overview

The `askA24zMemory` tool is your AI agent's primary interface to the project's institutional knowledge. It searches through stored notes, documentation, and insights to provide contextually relevant guidance.

<RequestExample>
```json
{
  "filePath": "/src/components/Button.tsx",
  "query": "What's the recommended approach for handling loading states in this project?",
  "taskContext": "I'm implementing a new form submission feature"
}
```
</RequestExample>

## Parameters

| Parameter     | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filePath`    | string   | Yes      | Absolute or relative path to the file or directory relevant to the query    |
| `query`       | string   | Yes      | Your specific question about the code or project                            |
| `taskContext` | string   | No       | Additional context about what you're trying to accomplish                   |
| `filterTags`  | string[] | No       | Filter results to notes with specific tags                                  |
| `filterTypes` | string[] | No       | Filter results by note type: 'decision', 'pattern', 'gotcha', 'explanation' |

## Use Cases

### Architecture Decisions

```
Query: "What were the architectural decisions made for the authentication system?"
Context: "Planning to extend user management features"
```

### Code Patterns

```
Query: "How do we typically handle error boundaries in React components?"
Context: "Adding error handling to a new feature component"
```

### Project Conventions

```
Query: "What's the project's approach to state management?"
Context: "Deciding between Redux and Context API for new feature"
```

### Debugging Help

```
Query: "What are common gotchas when working with the API client?"
Context: "Debugging authentication issues"
```

## Response Format

The tool returns a structured response containing:

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "answer": "Based on the project notes, we use React Context API for state management in this project. The decision was made in [note-id] because it provides better tree-shaking and is sufficient for our current scale.",
  "relevantNotes": [
    {
      "id": "note-1234567890-abc123",
      "title": "State Management Decision",
      "content": "We chose Context API over Redux for...",
      "confidence": "high",
      "type": "decision",
      "tags": ["architecture", "state-management"],
      "anchors": ["/src/contexts", "/src/hooks"]
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider using the AuthContext for user state",
    "Check existing hooks in /src/hooks for reusable patterns"
  ]
}
```

### No Results Found

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "answer": "I don't have any specific notes about this topic yet. This appears to be a new area for the project.",
  "relevantNotes": [],
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider creating a note documenting this decision for future reference",
    "Use the create_repository_note tool to capture this knowledge"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific

```
❌ Bad: "How does this work?"
✅ Good: "How do we handle form validation in this React project?"
```

### Provide Context

```
❌ Bad: "What's the API pattern?"
✅ Good: "I'm building a new endpoint for user preferences. What's the existing API pattern in this project?"
```

### Use File Paths

```
❌ Bad: "How do we style buttons?"
✅ Good: "How do we style buttons?" with filePath: "/src/components/Button.tsx"
```

### Follow Up Questions

The tool often provides suggestions for follow-up questions or related topics to explore.

## Error Handling

### Invalid File Path

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File path does not exist or is not accessible",
  "suggestion": "Verify the file path is correct and the file exists"
}
```

### Repository Not Found

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No Git repository found in the current directory",
  "suggestion": "Ensure you're working within a Git repository"
}
```

### Permission Denied

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Permission denied accessing repository notes",
  "suggestion": "Check file permissions for the .a24z-memory directory"
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Getting Started

```json
{
  "filePath": ".",
  "query": "What's known about this project?",
  "taskContext": "New developer onboarding"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

- Overview of project architecture
- Key conventions and patterns
- Important configuration decisions
- Common gotchas to avoid

### Example 2: Code Review

```json
{
  "filePath": "/src/api/userService.ts",
  "query": "How should I implement error handling for API calls?",
  "taskContext": "Code review feedback"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

- Project's error handling patterns
- Specific examples from similar services
- Best practices for API error handling
- Testing recommendations

### Example 3: Architecture Planning

}
```

**Expected Response:**

- Component architecture decisions
- Common patterns (HOC, hooks, etc.)
- Styling conventions
- State management patterns

## Integration with AI Agents

This tool is designed to be called proactively by AI agents. The system prompt should include instructions to:

1. **Check for existing knowledge** before making assumptions
2. **Use specific file paths** to get relevant context
3. **Ask follow-up questions** when needed
4. **Document new insights** after solving problems
