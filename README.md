## One Platform, Three Experiences

Alexandria provides persistent memory infrastructure that enhances how AI agents, developers, and teams work with codebases.

### ü§ñ For AI Agents: CLI + MCP Server
**Give your AI agents perfect memory**
- Install once, works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible tool
- Agents remember context across sessions and share knowledge
- No more re-explaining your codebase every conversation
- To Get StartedL `npm install -g a24z-memory`


### üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers: VS Code Extension
**Your intelligent coding companion**
- View Code References Associated With Feature Documentation For Quick Context
- Visual codebase navigation and understanding
- Install from VS Code marketplace:  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20in%20VS%20Code-0098FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%7B%22name%22%3A%22a24z-memory%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22a24z-memory%22%5D%7D)


### üë• For Teams: Alexandria Website
**Your team's collective intelligence hub**
- Web-based dashboard for entire engineering organization
- Up To Date Documentation Your Agents Are Maintaining about Your Codebase
- Manage codebase views and documentation standards
- Enterprise features for governance and compliance
- Coming Soon: Alexandria Librarian - Agentic Research powered by pixeltable

## The Problem We Solve

**Without Alexandria:**
- üîÑ Repeat yourself to every AI agent
- üìù Documentation goes stale immediately
- üß† Lose context between sessions
- ü§ù No knowledge sharing between tools

**With Alexandria:**
- ‚úÖ Persistent memory across all sessions
- üìä Living documentation that evolves
- üîó Shared context between all tools
- üöÄ 10x faster development velocity

## How It Works



### Real Example: Authentication Refactor

**Without Alexandria:**
```
Day 1: Explain auth system to Claude ‚Üí implements feature
Day 2: Explain auth system to Cursor ‚Üí different approach
Day 3: Explain auth system to new dev ‚Üí inconsistent patterns
Result: Three different implementations, technical debt
```

**With Alexandria:**
```
Day 1: Claude learns auth system ‚Üí saves to memory as a Doc Associated with a Codebase View
Day 2: Cursor reads Doc and is aware of references -> Updates Documentation on Pre-commit hook with our validation system
Day 3: New dev uses VS Code ‚Üí sees all context and finds files quickly
Result: Consistent, maintainable code
```
